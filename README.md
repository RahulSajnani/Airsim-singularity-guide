# Airsim-singularity-guide
Instructions and code to run AirSim binaries on singularity.

This README assumes you have singularity v3.7.1 configured on your system. Ever wondered how to run AirSim binaries in a singularity container with GPUs? If so, then you are in the right location. This repository is tested to run in headless mode only.

### Steps to follow

1. Clone the repository and change working directory

   ```bash
   # Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/RahulSajnani/Airsim-singularity-guide
   
   # Change directory
   cd Airsim-singularity-guide
   ```

2. Pull the AirSim image from DockerHub

   ```bash
   # Pull the AirSim image from dockerhub
   singularity pull docker://rahulsajnani/airsim_binary:10.0-devel-ubuntu18.04
   ```

3. Download the appropriate environment binary from the AirSim release page [here](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/releases/tag/v1.4.0-linux)

   ```bash
   # For demonstration we will download Blocks.zip
   wget https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/releases/download/v1.4.0-linux/Blocks.zip
   
   # Unzip Blocks environment
   unzip Blocks.zip
   ```

4. Run the binary inside the singularity container:

   ```bash
   # Run the binary headless with openGL 4
   /bin/bash ./run_airsim_image_binary.sh ./airsim_binary_10.0-devel-ubuntu18.04.sif ./Blocks/LinuxNoEditor/Blocks.sh -- headless -opengl4
   ```
